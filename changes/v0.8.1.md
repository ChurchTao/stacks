This is another significant release of Stacks! This release is focused on polish.

The headline feature is the overhaul of local storage to become more effective and robust. Unfortunately, this means your storage will be reset once you upgrade, resulting in the loss of your old clippings.

We've introduced a new note action, allowing you to quickly capture your thoughts. And yes, finally, you can now re-copy images in your clipboard history!

An interesting new feature: when you're currently inside a Stack, new clippings will go to that Stack. This allows you to pick a Stack, and then copy several things, collecting them all into one place.

We've continued to iterate on focus control, making it feel more fluid and effective. The clipboard poller now skips items written to the clipboard by Stacks, and focus/filter resets after 30 seconds of being in the background.

We've also made some tweaks to the light / dark themes.

Enjoy the new features and improvements!
