v0.8.2 is a minor quality of life release.

Naming a Stack now provides a default based on the current date/time, supporting daily note style Stack creation.

The Meta Panel for Text items now shows word (w) char (c) and GPT4 / tiktoken (t) counts for the text. facilitating using a Stack to prepare context for LLMs.

Also, hitting 'Esc' will now just deactivate focus rather than exiting your current Stack, hopefully making navigation feel more solid.

Full change notes:

feat: when adding an item to a Stack, add a default to create new Stack name based on the current date / time, to support daily note style Stack creation
feat: word / char / token (GPT4) now shown in the Meta Panel for Text items
