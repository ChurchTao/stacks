v0.8.3 adds basic ability to pipe text items to shell command

This is a first stab at this feature to start getting a feel for how to
structure the UX.

Some obvious deficiencies:

- perserve terminal colors
- streaming responses
- improve display of stderr
- the piped item should be "touched"
- actions to move command or response to the clipboard
- quick filter for previously used commands
- once a command is working well, the ability to apply it to a large number of
  items
- access clipbard / stacks inside command editor: Mike, as you've pointed out,
  we need this for the Editor / New note too
