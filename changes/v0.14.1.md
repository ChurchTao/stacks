While the previous release, v0.13.1, focused on a major revamp of Stacks' internals for performance, this release concentrates on refining the user experience. Key updates include:

- GitHub Flavored Markdown extensions
- new keyboard shortcuts
- fixes for rough edges when creating and editing clips
- and "item" has been renamed to "clip" throughout the UI, for consistency
