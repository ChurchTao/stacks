Initially aimed at enhancing pipe interactions, this release unexpectedly pivoted to quality of life improvements.

- The thing you'll notice first with the 0.11 release is the preview now shows all items in a Stack, not just the active one. A game-changer for todo lists and document drafting.

- A feature that warrants the use of "finally": Manually order items in a Stack. Use movement keys (Ctrl N/P or arrow keys) with the CMD modifier. Look for the sort order indicator at the bottom left of the status bar to toggle between manual and auto sort.

- Also note the padlock indicator at the bottom left of the status bar. Locking a Stack keeps new clipboard items from polluting it. Manually created Stacks default to locked.
  
- You can now set content types for clips to activate syntax highlighting in previews. Think HTML or Python code.

- Want a Stack at the top? Just hit CMD-T for "Touch" or "Top".

This release leaves some known issues unaddressed, most notably errors around the ChatGPT API.
