This release is experimental. It allows you to mirror a single Stack to cross.stream.

For Stacks power users, you'll get an access token for https://cross.stream. Input this token into the settings panel.

You'll see a lightning bolt icon at the bottom left after that. It shows if the current Stack is broadcasting. To publish a Stack, select it and activate the broadcast feature.

To view your live Stack, go to https://<yourusername>.cross.stream.
