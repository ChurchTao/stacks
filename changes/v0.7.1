This is the biggest release of Stacks, yet!

The headline feature is the first iteration of Stacks namesake feature: Stacks.

You can now begin assembling a basic Stack of clips. Hit 'TAB' to add a clip to a Stack.

Additional changes:

- The filter bar is now always visible. ESC clears the current filter.
- The light / dark themes have been tweaked slightly.
