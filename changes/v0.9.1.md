Nearly 6 weeks in the making, v0.9.1 has finally arrived.

The most significant change you'll notice is that all clippings now reside within a Stack, making Stacks the top-level navigation element.

Take a break for precisely one hour, perhaps for lunch or a coffee, and when you return, new clippings will populate a fresh, empty Stack named after the current time. If the session turns out to be noteworthy, you can rename it using CMD-E.

Be aware that this update necessitates another database reset. If you'd find a tool for dumping the previous database useful, let me know.

The option to copy an entire Stack has been temporarily removed but will be reinstated in the next release. If this affects you significantly, give me a heads up, and I'll expedite that update.
