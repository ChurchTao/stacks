v0.8.4 quick fix to v0.8.3:

Since Stacks is run by the system, the user's SHELL preferences (particularly
PATH), aren't set. This is a quick fix update to v0.8.3 to attempt to source
the user's SHELL config, before running the provided command.

Only zsh and bash are attempted so far.

v0.8.3 adds basic ability to pipe text items to shell command

This is a first stab at this feature to start getting a feel for how to
structure the UX.

Some obvious deficiencies:

- perserve terminal colors
- streaming responses
- improve display of stderr
- the piped item should be "touched"
- actions to move command or response to the clipboard
- quick filter for previously used commands
- once a command is working well, the ability to apply it to a large number of
  items
- access clipbard / stacks inside command editor: Mike, as you've pointed out,
  we need this for the Editor / New note too
